<h3>🐉About Me</h3>
<p>I'm an American who has lived and worked in Japan since 2006! (That's a very long time for anyone keeping score...)  I started out in the JET Programme in my early life here, and worked my way all the way up to teaching English at the university level.  I pivoted to a career in programming and web dev once I realized that I had basically been self-teaching myself to code my whole life, and was actually <i>good</i> at it.  "Why don't I just do THIS for a living??" I thought, "I love this stuff!", and went for a more formal education through Le Wagon in Tokyo.  Now I'm here, writing on the wall of my GitHub page for all to see! (<i>insert vigorous jazzhands here 🫲🙌🫱</i>)  </p>
